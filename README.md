# âš¡ Real-Time Charging Station Recommendation Engine for EVs

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Abhijitxx/IDT-Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Electric Vehicle (EV) drivers frequently encounter issues like range anxiety, unexpected charger congestion, and inefficient route planning. This project introduces a Real-Time Charging Station Recommendation Engine that intelligently suggests optimal charging points using real-time data and user preferences.

The engine considers multiple live factors including vehicle battery status, energy consumption patterns, traffic, charger availability, and user-defined preferences such as cost sensitivity, preferred charger speed, and maximum detour tolerance. By dynamically analyzing this information, the system recommends the best available stations and reroutes if conditions change mid-trip.

## ðŸ“„ Contents

The repository includes the final project report and the accompanying presentation slides. Both documents detail the system design, architecture, workflow, and use-case scenarios.

- Report.pdf â€“ Detailed technical documentation of the project
- Presentation.pptx â€“ Slide deck used to present the system and its components

## âœ… Key Features

- Real-time charging recommendations based on vehicle and environmental data
- Personalization of charger selection according to user preferences
- Automatic rerouting if a recommended station becomes unavailable
- Focused on improving energy efficiency and reducing wait times

## ðŸš€ Technology

The system is designed to integrate with real-time APIs and cloud services for live data handling. Though IoT is not used, the architecture supports API-based vehicle telemetry and station data inputs for real-time operations.
